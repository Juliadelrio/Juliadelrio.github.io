  <p class= "text"> I'm Way Cooler Online" is an Augmented Reality experience which Update the self-portrait to the current medium and cultural state (digital, post-internet, social networks...). Work with an old concept as the self-portrait from the languages and aesthetics of the internet digital culture. How digital/post-internet culture shape self representation and social relationships. Integrate the mirror selfie portrait experience with those aesthetics and ideas from the online representation of the self, reflect the medium, the device on the mirror as a part of the person who holds it. 
  The medium represent itself in that selfportrait as an inseparable part of the person. An experience integrated in the ritual of a mirror selfie. The way to use the device takes the dynamics from a mirror selfie and the cell phone become the core element of the modifications of the image take by the camera. Proposed scenario and interaction take the behaviours and dynamics from the action of take a selfie in front of a bathroom mirror. The device is part of the conceptRegarding to the relation between concept and technic, Iâ€™m interested in the device which allows to generate that augmented reality as a part of the concept and not just a mere tool disconnected from the discourse. The joint element between AR and selfie idea andthe construction of an identity in the social networks is, in this case, the cell phone which support both of them and, more particularly the cell device camera.
